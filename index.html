              Vancouver is surrounded by ocean and mountains, which makes for
              spectacular views from essentially any vantage point in the city
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you know a little about Vancouver's history, you likely know
              the name came from Capt. George Vancouver, a British naval officer
              and explorer who sailed through the area in the 1790s. Recommended

              culture in Vancouver These 2 breathtaking Vancouver hotels were
              ranked among the world's best But that's not the whole story.
              Vancouver's family name can be traced back to a northern Dutch
              town on the German border with very little in common with the
              Canadian metropolis. It's called Coevorden. It's from there that
              the ancestors of George Vancouver came; at one point they were the
              van Coevordens, which is essentially saying they were "from
              Coevorden." The name Coevorden originated from the Dutch words for
              "cow crossing"; it's not unheard of for towns to be named that way
              (Oxford in England, for one). And there is, in fact, a river at
              Coevorden, just like Vancouver (though it's significantly smaller
              than the Fraser). So to extend the translation, Vancouver means
              "from the cow crossing."
