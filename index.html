            <h3>
              Vancouver is surrounded by ocean and mountains, which makes for
              spectacular views from essentially any vantage point in the city
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you know a little about Vancouver's history, you likely know
              the name came from Capt. George Vancouver, a British naval officer
              and explorer who sailed through the area in the 1790s. Recommended

              culture in Vancouver These 2 breathtaking Vancouver hotels were
              ranked among the world's best But that's not the whole story.
              Vancouver's family name can be traced back to a northern Dutch
              town on the German border with very little in common with the
              Canadian metropolis. It's called Coevorden. It's from there that
              the ancestors of George Vancouver came; at one point they were the
              van Coevordens, which is essentially saying they were "from
              Coevorden." The name Coevorden originated from the Dutch words for
              "cow crossing"; it's not unheard of for towns to be named that way
              (Oxford in England, for one). And there is, in fact, a river at
              Coevorden, just like Vancouver (though it's significantly smaller
              than the Fraser). So to extend the translation, Vancouver means
              "from the cow crossing."

                <p>
                  One of Vancouver’s top attractions is nothing more than a
                  paved pathway that stretches some 28 km (17.5 miles) around
                  the city’s waterfront. But what a path it is! Known simply as
                  “the seawall,” you’ll find that following this route, whether
                  on foot or bicycle, is one of the best ways to discover
                  Vancouver. In fact, spending a day exploring Vancouver’s
                  seawall ranks as one of the very best ways to spend a day
                  while you’re in the city.

                <p>
                  Ideally situated on a peninsula at the northwestern edge of
                  downtown Vancouver, Stanley Park is one of the city's main
                  tourist destinations, attracting approximately 8 million
                  visitors each year. Featuring lovely beaches, miles of
                  well-maintained paved and dirt trails, and an array of
                  can't-miss kid-friendly spots (including a pool, water park,
                  miniature railway and more), this 400-hectare (1,000-acre)
                  haven is recognized as one of the greatest urban parks in the
                  world.

                <p>
                  Gastown is a neighbourhood that seamlessly combines old with
                  new, history with the way forward. An essential part of
                  Vancouver’s history, a visit to Gastown should include a
                  stroll along Water Street, where you’ll find a picture-perfect
                  collection of old buildings, cobblestones, the Steam Clock,
                  and vintage lampposts. Gastown is home to many of the city’s
                  hottest restaurants, making it a great pick for a special
                  night out.
